In Object-oriented programming, encapsulation is an important principle. This principle involves hiding the internal details of an object while providing a public interface to interact with it. This protects the data inside the object and ensures that it can only be accessed or modified through the methods provided by the object. One way to achieve encapsulation is through the use of access modifiers such as static, protected, and private.

The static modifier is applied to class-level members. These members belong to the class itself, rather than instances of the class. This allows them to be accessed without creating an instance of the class and is useful for utility or helper methods that don't require state or behavior specific to an instance. The private modifier, on the other hand, makes members inaccessible from outside the class, protecting the internal state of the class. Protected is similar to private, but allows subclasses to access these members. It allows to hide implementation details but still provide some level of flexibility. Using these access modifiers, we can control the visibility and accessibility of class members, thus making the code robust, maintainable, and secure.
